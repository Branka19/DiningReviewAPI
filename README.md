## CodeCademy final Spring portfolio project

**Goal:** creating a RESTful API with Spring using H2, Lombok, Spring Data JPA

- The dining review API consists of users, dining reviews and restaurants.
- Users can submit reviews for a restaurant and give scores from 1-5 related to allergies (peanuts, eggs, dairy).
- Scores for each allergy as well as the overall score are then shown for an individual restaurant.
